# @storybook/astro

An experimental Storybook framework implementation that enables support for Astro components in Storybook.

> **⚠️ Experimental**: This is an experimental project and is not ready for production use. The implementation is actively being developed and tested.

## Requirements

- **Node.js**: 20.16.0+, 22.19.0+, or 24.0.0+ (required for Storybook 10's ESM-only support)
- **Storybook**: 10.0.0+
- **Astro**: 6.0.0-beta (see [Astro 6 Beta Compatibility](#astro-6-beta-compatibility))
- **Vite**: 6.0.0+ (7.x supported)

## What This Package Does

This package provides a complete Storybook framework integration for Astro components, enabling developers to:

- **Document and test Astro components** in Storybook's interactive environment
- **Server-side render Astro components** using Astro's Container API
- **Support multiple UI frameworks** within Astro components (React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, Solid, Alpine.js)
- **Live preview components** with hot module replacement during development
- **Build and deploy static Storybook** with pre-rendered Astro components
- **Handle component hydration** and client-side interactivity

## Architecture

The package consists of two main components:

### 1. `@storybook/astro` (Framework Package)

The core framework implementation that integrates Astro with Storybook's build system:

- **Vite Plugin Integration**: Configures Vite to handle Astro components during the Storybook build process
- **Middleware Handler**: Sets up an Astro Container that renders components server-side on demand
- **Framework Integrations**: Manages multiple UI framework renderers (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) that can be used within Astro components
- **Module Resolution**: Handles special module resolution for Astro's runtime and framework-specific modules

**Key files:**
- `src/preset.ts` - Storybook framework configuration and Vite setup
- `src/middleware.ts` - Astro Container setup and server-side rendering handler
- `src/integrations/` - Integration adapters for React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, Solid, and Alpine.js
- `src/viteStorybookAstroMiddlewarePlugin.ts` - Vite plugin for handling render requests (dev)
- `src/vitePluginAstroBuildPrerender.ts` - Pre-renders Astro component stories at build time
- `src/vitePluginAstroComponentMarker.ts` - Patches Astro 6's client-side `.astro` stubs for Storybook
- `src/vitePluginAstroFontsFallback.ts` - Stubs Astro 6's font virtual modules

### 2. `@storybook/astro-renderer` (Client Renderer)

The client-side rendering package that manages how Astro components are displayed in Storybook's preview:

- **Render Function**: Determines how to render different component types (Astro components, HTML strings, DOM elements, framework components)
- **Communication Layer**: Sends render requests from the browser to the Astro middleware via Vite's HMR channel
- **Fallback Rendering**: Delegates to framework-specific renderers (React, Vue, etc.) when `parameters.renderer` is specified
- **Style Management**: Handles Astro's scoped styles and HMR updates
- **Script Execution**: Manages client-side scripts and hydration for interactive components

**Key files:**
- `src/render.tsx` - Main rendering logic and Canvas integration
- `src/preset.ts` - Client-side preview annotations

## How It Works

### Dev Mode (`storybook dev`)

1. **Story Definition**: Stories import Astro components (`.astro` files) and define variations with different props
2. **Component Detection**: The renderer identifies Astro components by checking for the `isAstroComponentFactory` flag (patched by `vitePluginAstroComponentMarker` in Astro 6)
3. **Server Rendering**: When an Astro component is detected, a render request is sent to the Vite dev server middleware via HMR
4. **Container Rendering**: The middleware uses Astro's Container API to render the component with the provided props and slots (with `patchCreateAstroCompat` to bridge the Astro compiler v2/v3 calling convention difference)
5. **HTML Injection**: The rendered HTML is sent back to the client and injected into Storybook's canvas
6. **Hydration**: Client-side scripts are executed to add interactivity (for frameworks like Alpine.js or framework islands)
7. **Framework Delegation**: For non-Astro framework components (React, Solid, Vue, etc.), the renderer delegates directly to the framework-specific `renderToCanvas` before calling `storyFn()`, avoiding orphaned reactive effects
8. **HMR Updates**: Changes to components trigger re-renders while preserving state when possible

### Static Build (`storybook build`)

Since Astro components require server-side rendering via the Container API, static builds use a **build-time pre-rendering** approach:

1. **SSR Server**: During the Vite build, `vitePluginAstroBuildPrerender` creates an internal Vite SSR server with AstroContainer
2. **Story Discovery**: For each story file that imports an `.astro` component, the plugin loads the full story module via `ssrLoadModule` to get fully evaluated args (including imported assets like images)
3. **Pre-rendering**: Each story variant is rendered using AstroContainer with its merged args (meta + story level)
4. **HTML Injection**: The pre-rendered HTML is injected as a `parameters.__astroPrerendered` property on each story export
5. **Asset Emission**: Any `/@fs` dev-server asset URLs (e.g. images) in the rendered HTML are emitted as Rollup assets with content-hashed filenames, and the URLs are rewritten to their final paths
6. **Client Runtime**: The renderer detects the pre-rendered HTML parameter and uses it directly, bypassing the HMR path

**Limitations of static builds:**
- Astro component stories are rendered with their default args at build time — changing args via the Controls panel has no effect
- Framework component stories (React, Vue, Svelte, etc.) are unaffected and remain fully interactive
- Stories that override the meta-level `component` are not pre-rendered

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a compatible Node.js version installed:
```bash
node --version
# Should be 20.16.0+, 22.19.0+, or 24.0.0+
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd storybook-astro
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Run Storybook:
   ```bash
   yarn storybook
   ```

4. Build a static Storybook:
   ```bash
   yarn build-storybook
   ```

5. Run tests (validates component rendering and framework integration health):
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## Usage Example

Create a story for an Astro component:

```javascript
// Card.stories.jsx
import Card from './Card.astro';

export default {
  title: 'Components/Card',
  component: Card,
};

export const Default = {
  args: {
    title: 'My Card Title',
    content: 'Card content goes here',
  },
};

export const Highlighted = {
  args: {
    title: 'Featured Card',
    content: 'This card is highlighted',
    highlight: true,
  },
};
```

## Testing and Portable Stories

### Component Testing with `composeStories`

The package includes a `composeStories` function that enables testing of Storybook stories outside the Storybook environment. This allows you to verify that components render correctly and detect integration issues with different frameworks.

```javascript
// Card.test.ts
import { composeStories } from '@storybook/astro';
import { testStoryRenders, testStoryComposition } from './test-utils';
import * as stories from './Card.stories.jsx';

const { Default, Highlighted } = composeStories(stories);

// Test that the story can be composed
testStoryComposition('Default', Default);

// Test that the story renders successfully in Storybook
testStoryRenders('Card Default', Default);
```

### Framework Integration Health

The test suite validates the health of all framework integrations by attempting to render components from each supported framework. All 17 test suites (36 tests) pass, covering Astro, React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, Solid, and Alpine.js components.

### Vitest / Vite 6 Compatibility

Vite 6's ESM module runner cannot evaluate raw CommonJS modules. The `cjsInteropPlugin()` in `lib/test-utils.ts` handles this by:
- Redirecting bare package imports to their ESM entry points via `resolveId`
- Auto-detecting and wrapping remaining CJS modules with ESM-compatible shims (providing `module`, `exports`, `require`, `__dirname`, `__filename`)

The `vitePluginAstroComponentMarker` is also loaded in the Vitest config so that portable stories can detect Astro components in the test environment.

### Solid Testing Limitation

Solid components render correctly in Storybook's browser, but the Vitest config intentionally uses a non-recursive include glob (`**/solid/*.tsx`) so that `vite-plugin-solid` does not compile the nested component files. This avoids an SSR/client mismatch: Vitest runs in happy-dom (client compilation mode), but the Solid runtime resolves to `server.js` where client APIs like `template()` throw. The portable stories tests validate Solid story composition without requiring actual Solid rendering.

### Available Testing Functions

- **`composeStories(stories)`** - Composes all stories from a story file for testing
- **`composeStory(story, meta)`** - Composes a single story for testing
- **`setProjectAnnotations(annotations)`** - Sets global Storybook configuration for tests

### Test Utilities

The project includes standardized test utilities:

- **`test-utils.ts`** (root) - Vitest test helpers:
  - `testStoryComposition(name, story)` - Verifies story can be imported and composed
  - `testStoryRenders(name, story)` - Validates story renders without errors
- **`lib/test-utils.ts`** - Vite plugins for the test environment:
  - `cjsInteropPlugin()` - Wraps CJS modules for Vite 6's ESM runner

These utilities provide consistent testing patterns across all component tests.

## Framework Integration

Configure framework integrations in `.storybook/main.js`:

```javascript
import { react, vue, svelte, preact, solid, alpinejs } from '@storybook/astro/integrations';

export default {
  framework: {
    name: '@storybook/astro',
    options: {
      integrations: [
        react({ include: ['**/react/**'] }),
        vue(),
        svelte(),
        preact({ include: ['**/preact/**'] }),
        solid({ include: ['**/solid/**'] }),
        alpinejs({ entrypoint: './.storybook/alpine-entrypoint.js' }),
      ],
    },
  },
};
```

> **Note**: The `include` patterns use recursive globs (`**`) to match components in nested directories (e.g. `solid/Counter/Counter.tsx`). A non-recursive glob like `**/solid/*` would fail to match files in subdirectories.

## Known Issues

### Solid Testing Limitation

Solid components render and work correctly in Storybook's browser. However, in the Vitest test environment, Solid's SSR compilation mode conflicts with the client-side runtime: the compiled code calls `template()` (a client API) but at runtime it resolves to `server.js` where `template` is aliased to a function that throws "Client-only API called on the server side". The workaround is a non-recursive include glob in `vitest.config.ts` so that `vite-plugin-solid` doesn't compile the nested component files. Composition tests still pass; actual Solid rendering is validated in the browser.

### Other Known Issues

- This is experimental software not ready for production
- Some Astro features may not work as expected in the Storybook environment
- Performance may need optimization for large component libraries
- Hot module replacement for styles requires manual trigger in some cases

## Astro 6 Beta Compatibility

Astro 6 introduced several breaking changes to how components are transformed and rendered. This section documents the differences and the compatibility layers that bridge them.

### 1. Component Detection (`vitePluginAstroComponentMarker`)

**Problem**: In Astro 6, the client-side Vite transform of `.astro` files produces a stub that throws "Astro components cannot be used in the browser" — without setting the `isAstroComponentFactory` marker that Storybook's renderer uses to identify Astro components and route them to server-side rendering.

**Solution**: A post-transform Vite plugin (`vitePluginAstroComponentMarker.ts`) detects the Astro 6 stub pattern and replaces it with a version that sets `isAstroComponentFactory = true` and preserves the `moduleId` for the server render request.

### 2. Props Passing (`patchCreateAstroCompat`)

**Problem**: The Astro compiler v2 generates `result.createAstro($$Astro, $$props, $$slots)` (3 args), but the Astro 6 runtime expects `result.createAstro($$props, $$slots)` (2 args). When v2-compiled components run against the v6 runtime, `$$Astro` is captured as "props" and actual props are lost.

**Solution**: `patchCreateAstroCompat()` in `middleware.ts` wraps the component factory and intercepts `createAstro` calls. If 3 arguments are detected, it strips the leading `$$Astro` argument.

### 3. Scoped CSS (`vitePluginAstroComponentMarker`)

**Problem**: Astro 6's client-side transform no longer includes `<style>` block imports. Storybook's preview iframe receives the component stub but none of the scoped CSS.

**Solution**: The component marker plugin reads the original `.astro` source, counts `<style>` blocks, and generates import statements for each style sub-module using Astro's convention: `Component.astro?astro&type=style&index=N&lang.css`. During builds, Astro's compile metadata cache is not populated for client-side transforms, so the sub-module imports would fail. Instead, the plugin extracts raw CSS directly from the `.astro` source and inlines it.

### 4. Font Virtual Modules (`vitePluginAstroFontsFallback`)

**Problem**: Astro 6's `astro:assets` module depends on font-related virtual modules (`virtual:astro:assets/fonts/runtime`, `virtual:astro:assets/fonts/internal`) and a bare `astro/assets/fonts/runtime` import. These fail to resolve in Storybook's SSR Vite server because the fonts plugin's filter-based `resolveId` doesn't trigger.

**Solution**: `vitePluginAstroFontsFallback.ts` stubs all three font module paths with no-op exports, since Storybook doesn't need Astro's font system.

### 5. Framework Renderer Delegation (`render.tsx`)

**Problem**: In Astro 5, `renderToCanvas()` called `storyFn()` first, then delegated to framework renderers. In Astro 6 with updated framework integrations, this created orphaned reactive effects for frameworks like Solid that manage their own rendering lifecycle.

**Solution**: `renderToCanvas()` now delegates to framework-specific renderers *before* calling `storyFn()`. This lets each framework (React, Solid, Vue, etc.) manage its own reactive root without interference.

### 6. CJS Module Interop (`cjsInteropPlugin`)

**Problem**: Vite 6's ESM module runner cannot evaluate raw CommonJS modules (e.g. `cssesc`, `cookie`, `react`). Several Astro 6 runtime dependencies are still CJS.

**Solution**: `cjsInteropPlugin()` in `lib/test-utils.ts` auto-detects CJS modules and wraps them with ESM-compatible shims providing `module`, `exports`, `require`, `__dirname`, and `__filename`. It also redirects bare package imports to ESM entry points when available. This plugin is used in `vitest.config.ts`.

## Roadmap: Astro Framework Feature Support

This section tracks Astro's built-in framework features and their compatibility status with Storybook Astro. Many Astro features rely on special module resolution (e.g., `astro:*` imports) that may require additional configuration to work within Storybook's environment.

### ✅ Supported Features

- **Component Rendering** - Core Astro component rendering via Container API
- **Props & Slots** - Passing data and content to components
- **Scoped Styles** - Component-scoped CSS (including Astro 6's style sub-module imports)
- **Multiple Framework Support** - React, Vue, Svelte, Preact, Solid, and Alpine.js
- **Client Directives** - `client:load`, `client:only`, etc. for framework components
- **Static Builds** - `storybook build` with build-time pre-rendering of Astro component stories

### ⚠️ Partial Support

- **`astro:assets` (Image Optimization)** - Works in components but requires fallback approach for Storybook stories due to module resolution issues. Components can accept both `ImageMetadata` and string URLs to maintain compatibility.
- **Astro Fonts** - Font virtual modules are stubbed with no-op exports. Components render correctly but without Astro's font optimization.

### ❌ Not Yet Supported

- **View Transitions** - Astro's built-in View Transitions API (`<ViewTransitions />` component)
- **Content Collections** - `astro:content` module for type-safe content management
- **Middleware** - Astro's middleware system for request/response handling
- **API Routes** - Server endpoints (`/pages/api/*` routes)
- **Server Islands** - Dynamic content islands with server-side rendering
- **Actions** - Type-safe backend functions callable from frontend (`astro:actions`)
- **Environment Variables** - `astro:env` module for managing environment variables
- **Glob Imports** - `Astro.glob()` for batch file imports
- **Database Integration** - Astro DB and database utilities
- **Internationalization (i18n)** - Built-in i18n routing and helpers
- **Prefetch** - Automatic page prefetching utilities
- **Dev Toolbar** - Development toolbar integrations
- **Markdown/MDX Features** - Advanced markdown processing features beyond basic rendering

### 🔮 Future Considerations

- **Dynamic Astro Controls in Static Builds** - Currently, Astro component stories are pre-rendered with their default args at build time. A future enhancement could add a companion server or service worker to enable live re-rendering with different args.
- **Adapters** - Integration with Astro's deployment adapters (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
- **Error Handling** - Better error boundaries and recovery mechanisms
- **Performance Optimizations** - Caching strategies and render optimization for large component libraries
